# EiV - Quick Linear Algebra and Matrix Access
## Tools & Plugins - Automations

## What is EiV?

EiV is a C++ and Blueprint Library for Unreal Engine that is powered by the Eigen library. Eigen is a free, third party linear algebra library for C++ that comes built-in🔧 to Unreal Engine. This plugin is meant to save you the hassle of trying to include Eigen in your own projects, to help the conversion between Unreal Engine and Eigen types be a bit smoother, and to provide an easy interface💻 to Eigen functionality in Blueprints! 

## Why EiV?

EiV is designed to be a time-saver⌚ when it comes to using linear algebra and Eigen in Unreal Engine. The include pattern it offers will save you all of the issues that come with including a third party library in Unreal Engine. EiV's macro-based include pattern makes sure that you only need to include the main header file to have access to all of the code you need in any C++ file. It also helps those that don't want to use C++ to still have linear algebra in blueprints! EiV also offers an ever-growing⬆️suite of functions for Blueprints to use linear algebra! If some part of the blueprint functionality looks incomplete, it will likely be added soon, since it takes a very long time to convert all of Eigen's functionality into Blueprints. You can go check out the EiV public GitHub repo to see what progress is being made, make suggestions, and maybe even get some updates before Fab!

## Features:
* 80+ Blueprint Functions and counting - EiV has growing blueprint support for linear algebra - something you won't find anywhere else!
* Dynamically-sized Real and Complex valued matrices for blueprints!
* 250+ C++ typedefs to make directly using Eigen types just a bit easier and to save you writing 'Eigen::' before everything
* 70+ C++ helper functions to help with converting back and forth between Unreal Engine and Eigen types
* All code is public on GitHub - check out what is being updated and even suggest new functions to add!
