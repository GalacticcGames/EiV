## What is EiV?

EiV is a **C++ and Blueprint Library** for [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) that is powered by the [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) library. Eigen is a **free**, third party **linear algebra library** for C++ that comes **built-in**üîß to Unreal Engine. This plugin is meant to **save you the hassle** of trying to **include** Eigen in your own projects, to help the conversion between Unreal Engine and Eigen types be a bit smoother, and to provide an **easy interface**üíª to **Eigen functionality in [Blueprints](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/blueprints-visual-scripting-in-unreal-engine)!** 

## Why EiV?

EiV is designed to be a *time-saver*‚åö when it comes to using linear algebra and Eigen in Unreal Engine. The include pattern it offers will *save you all of the issues* that come with including a third party library in Unreal Engine. EiV's macro-based include pattern makes sure that you *only need to include the main header* file to have access to *all of the code you need* in any C++ file. It also helps those that don't want to use C++ to still have linear algebra in blueprints! EiV also offers an *ever-growing*‚¨ÜÔ∏è*suite of functions* for Blueprints to use linear algebra! If some part of the blueprint functionality looks incomplete, it will likely be added soon, since it takes a very long time to convert all of Eigen's functionality into Blueprints. You can go check out the EiV **public GitHub repo (you are already here)** to see what progress is being made, make suggestions, and maybe even get some updates before Fab!

## Features:
* **80+ Blueprint Functions** and counting - EiV has **growing blueprint support** for linear algebra - *something you won't find anywhere else!*
* **Dynamically-sized Real** and **Complex** valued matrices for blueprints!
* **250+ C++ typedefs** to make directly using Eigen types just a bit easier and to save you writing 'Eigen::' before everything
* **70+ C++ helper functions** to help with converting back and forth between Unreal Engine and Eigen types
* <ins>All code is public on GitHub</ins> - check out what is being updated and even suggest new functions to add!

## Documentation:

### Getting Started:

To begin using EiV, first either download the plugin from Fab or from the GitHub repository and build it from source. EiV is engineered in Unreal Engine 5.1 to ensure it is compatible with versions 5.1 and above, however, Fab will only be guaranteed to have the latest three engine versions available. Once you have EiV in your engine's plugin directory *(Engine / Plugins / Marketplace /)*, open the project you want to use it in and enable the plugin. It should be under the programming category. You may need to restart Unreal Engine for changes to take effect. Then you should be good to go to start using Eigen through EiV in C++ and Blueprints. More specific instructions for each are in the below sections.

| Unreal Engine Version | EiV Compatible |
| --------------------- | -------------- |
| 4.27 and below        | ‚ùå            |
| 5.0                   | ‚ùå            |
| 5.1                   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Build From Source |
| 5.2                   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Build From Source |
| 5.3                   | ‚úÖ Available on Fab |
| 5.4                   | ‚úÖ Available on Fab |
| 5.5                   | ‚úÖ Available on Fab |

| Platform | Supported |
| -------- | --------- |
| Windows (32/64 bit) | Yes |
| Mac | Yes |
| iOS | No |
| Android | No |
| Linux | Yes |

Any platform not supported currently can be supported with some changes in `EiVLibrary.h`. If you want to suggest changes that can be made to allow EiV to support these platforms feel free to do so!

> [!NOTE]
> If you experience any errors on restarting or building just after EiV is activated (particularly relating to expecting to find a type declared in a module rules), See the [C++ section](#C++:) of the documentation for some tips on resolving that.

### Blueprints:

Using EiV in Blueprints is quite simple. It is just implemented as a Blueprint Function Library and should be accessible from the context menu by searching for 'EiV' (It will appear as 'Ei V' because of the way the engine parses text). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Not all EiV blueprint types do something as of now. We are working on adding and improving blueprint implementations over time, since Eigen is a large library to turn into blueprint functions.

Most EiV types are accessed via converter nodes. These nodes take what will be converted to the other type on one end and then swap that input type to the output. For example, the node below has a Matrix input and an Eigen Matrix input. Both of these inputs are reflected as outputs. When a normal matrix is input to this converter, the converter outputs the converted type from the Out Eigen Matrix pin. The pattern follows for an Eigen Matrix input - it is output from the Out Matrix pin. **Inputs do not directly carry through this node.** If a input pin is unconnected, that is no problem for EiV and it will just output the conversion of the empty type (often being 0 or some null matrix for blank inputs).

Once you have an Eigen/EiV type in your blueprint, you can use the EiV functions for those types. These functions are more or less a 1:1 mapping to the actual Eigen functions, so checking out the [Eigen documentation](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/) should help you understand how they work if you are unfamiliar.

### C++:

To use EiV in C++ is a bit more complicated than in Blueprints, but still far simpler than setting up Eigen yourself in C++. First, make sure you have an Unreal Engine project configured for C++. Then, go to whatever module you plan on using EiV in. Open up the `build.cs` file for that module and add the string, `"EiV"`, to the public and/or private dependency module lists as needed. EiV should be all linked up to your module and you should be good to start using EiV functionality in your modules files.

To include EiV in a `.h` or `.cpp` file, you need to follow a special pattern to make sure you access the Eigen modules you need and that their access doesn't spill over to other files where it may be unnecessary. An example of an EiV include is below.

```c
// ...

#define EIV_INCLUDE_DENSE_MATRIX_ARRAY
#define EIV_INCLUDE_GEOMETRY
#define EIV_UNDEFINE_INCLUDES

#include "EiVLibrary.h"

// ...
```

What this include pattern does is it allows you to define macros that represent the Eigen headers you want to access through EiV. EiV takes those headers, includes the necessary files, and adds on its own extra utilities as needed for what was included. To break it down header by header, `#define EIV_INCLUDE_DENSE_MATRIX_ARRAY` defines a macro for retrieving all headers associated with arrays and dense matrices, `#define EIV_INCLUDE_GEOMETRY` includes the Eigen Geometry module, and `#define EIV_UNDEFINE_INCLUDES` undefines any of these include macros within this file, effectively making them local when the `#include` preprocessor pastes in the `EiVLibrary.h` file. 

What the undefinition of these macros allows for is letting you access Eigen in another file within this module you are working in while not necessarily including anything you accessed in any other file, thus allowing for enhanced IWYU *(Include What You Use)* formatting and procedure. See more on Unreal Engine's take on IWYU [here](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/include-what-you-use-iwyu-for-unreal-engine-programming).

Here is a list of EiV macros to declare before an include and what they do:

| `#define EIV_UNDEFINE_INCLUDES`     | This macro undefines all of the above macros after EiV is included in the file |

Once EiV is all included, you can just start coding using the usual C++, Unreal Engine, and Eigen techniques. EiV also provides a helper struct, (`FEiVHelper`) to assist in conversions from Unreal Engine to Eigen types and provide a few other options for settings things up with Eigen. 

> [!WARNING]
> If you included EiV in your public and private module dependencies and your IDE still says it cannot include `EiVLibrary.h`, at least in Visual Studio, there is a simple enough fix. All you need to do is go to Project->Properties, and then in the new window, Config Properties->VC++ Directories, and finally put `$(LibraryPath)` in the Library Directories field. Refresh the VS project and intellisense should be albe to acces the Eigen and EiV types now. Even if you cannot resolve this, the project will still work just fine, but you unfortunately won't have easy access to any form of intellisense for working with EiV and Eigen.
